Yet another automaker skimping on digitial secutity.  This time it's
Nissan whose Leaf has a web app that allows you to check battery status,
but also manage the climate control remotely, yet has absolutely zero
authentication, allowing anyone with your VIN to freely roast or freeze
you out.

Here's an [excellent writeup][blogpost] by [Troy Hunt][about] detailing
how the exploit was found, tested and eventually exposed after Nissan
dragged their feet in addresing the issue once it was brought to their
attention.
