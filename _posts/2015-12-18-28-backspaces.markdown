Via [SC Magazine][sc-article], researchers from the [Cybersecurity Group at Polytechnic University of Valencia][upv-site]
found an exploit in [GRUB2][grub-manual] where pressing backspace 28 times at the login prompt
causes an integer underflow that runs GRUB2's rescue shell.

For all the gory details, you can check out [the full writeup][bug-breakdown].  I'm always amazed by the amount of damage
that can be caused/fixed with something as simple as changing
{% highlight js %}
if(key == '\b')
{% endhighlight %}
to
{% highlight js %}
if(key == '\b' && cur_len)
{% endhighlight %}
