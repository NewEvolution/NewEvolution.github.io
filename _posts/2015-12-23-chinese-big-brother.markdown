Via [Reuters][reuters-article], a Chinese anti-terrorism law is in committee that could require companies operating
in China to install back doors and turn over encryption keys to allow access to information.

US officials have complained that the law applies unfair pressure on foreign firms, while China counters that
similar laws have been proposed in the west for counter terrorism and they are only concerned with their security.

With terrorist organizations increasingly using social media for recruiting and communication, I can only see the
tension between privacy and security increasing in the future, both in the US and abroad.
